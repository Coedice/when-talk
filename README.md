# WhenTalk

**Estimate when speakers will get their turn in Federal Parliament debates.**

A tool to predict the start time for a speaker in the Australian federal parliament. By entering the bill being debated and the expected speaker order, WhenTalk analyzes live parliamentary minutes to estimate when each speaker is likely to begin.

## Features

- **Live debate tracking** - Connects to current parliamentary minutes to get accurate timing data
- **Speaker timeline** - Visualizes estimated speaking times for your list of speakers
- **Bill matching** - Automatically finds the relevant debate for any bill title you enter
- **Shareable links** - Generate and share your speaker timelines

## Getting Started

1. Visit the [live board](https://coedice.github.io/when-talk/)
2. Enter the **bill title** being debated (e.g., "Australia Act 1986")
3. List the **expected speaker order**, one name per line
4. WhenTalk will display estimated start times for each speaker based on live parliamentary data

## How It Works

WhenTalk fetches live parliamentary minutes and analyzes the debate data to estimate speaking durations. It uses this information to calculate when each speaker in your list is likely to take the floor.
